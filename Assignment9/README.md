## Notebooks
### Question-and-answer dataset
Question and Answer dataset from CMU corpus. Tab delimied data files from 2008, 2009 and 2010 are combined into one single file merged_qa.csv and manually uploaded to colab

2. Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate [Notebook](https://github.com/shashankhalo7/TheSchoolOfAI-END-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment9/QA_CMU_Dataset_using_Neural_Machine_Translation.ipynb)
### Quora question pair
Quora Questions pair [dataset](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) . Tab delimied data file 'quora_duplicate_questions.csv' and manually uploaded to colab. We use only questions pair that are semantically equivalent ones for this exercise to train a question paraphrasing model.

### Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus

This corpus contains a large metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts with around220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters, involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies and in total 304,713 utterances. We Used movie-lines and movie_conversations text files to generate 221282 ordered dialogue pairs which are used as Input and Output for the Seq2Seq models
